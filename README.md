<b><h1>Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering</h1></b>
<b><h3>Project Overview</h3></b>
<p>This project implements customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior, which can be used for targeted marketing and personalized customer experiences.</p>
<b><h3>Project Steps</h3></b>
<spam>1. Data Exploration: Analyze the dataset to understand its structure and features.</spam><br>
<spam>2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and scale the data to prepare it for clustering.</spam><br>
<spam>3. K-Means Clustering: Apply the K-Means algorithm to segment customers into distinct clusters.</spam><br>
<spam>4. Evaluation: Use methods like the Elbow method and Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters and assess the quality of clustering.</spam><br>
<spam>5. Visualization: Visualize the resulting customer segments using 2D and 3D scatter plots to understand the distribution of clusters.</spam><br>
<b><h3>Technologies Used</h3></b>
